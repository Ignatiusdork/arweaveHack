        Arweave stands out due to its distinctive role as both our storage and application service, operating in a decentralized manner.
        In our application,we utilize Arweave for data reading and writing, as well as deploying the application's code onto Arweave, enabling app delivery through web browsers.

        While this concept might initially require some comprehension, Arweave functions through nodes and gateways. The nodes oversee storage and blockweave aspects, whereas the gateways manage Cache, RPC API, and Query functionalities. 
        It's within the gateway that the true magic happens for our decentralized applications. Through metadata tags like 'Content-Type,' data storage allows us to guide gateway servers in data presentation. 
        Consequently, a web browser can seamlessly interact with our application, almost as if the gateway were a web server.
